I designed a React frontend based on Instagram's UI and incorporated the TanStack React Query, React Router, Axios, and styled-components frameworks. I also built a Node and Express backend to handle various operations, such as logging in or following other users, and integrated JSON Web Token authentication to restrict routes from unregistered users. Additionally, I utilized bcrypt hashing to protect passwords stored in the database. For data storage, I implemented the server to communicate with MongoDB and Cloudinary to store text-based information and pictures, respectively."
